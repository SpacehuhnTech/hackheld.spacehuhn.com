Hackheld is a DIY, open-source, hackable handheld designed to be easy to build and customize. It is based on the ESP8266 Lolin D1 Mini development board and features a 1.3" OLED display, six buttons, and a NeoPixel RGB LED. It runs the [Deauther](https://deauther.com) firmware, which allows it to perform various tests against Wi-Fi networks.

While the primary purpose of the HackHeld Vega is to allow anyone to easily and cheaply build their own [OLED Deauther](https://deauther.com/docs/usage/display), it can also be used as a general-purpose ESP8266 development board with a display. The pinout is printed on the back of the PCB. 

I also want to make more handheld hacking tools in the future, so stay tuned! I posted some insights into the design process on [my Blog](https://blog.spacehuhn.com/new-hackhelds) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/spacehuhn/) ðŸ˜Š.
